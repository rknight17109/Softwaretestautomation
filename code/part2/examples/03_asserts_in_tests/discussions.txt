Can a unit test have multiple asserts?

A good unit test should not have any independent asserts.

For example:
we have a function that changes a persons full name.
We can assert change to their first and change to their last name.
Two asserts but those are dependent on the action being performed.

If we have a test that calls two actions and is followed by two
asserts - that is a no-no. Failure of one will hid the other.

Exception, if we can keep the test concise *and* make sure both the
asserts will run even in case of failure of one. This for example,
can be done using assertAll that is part of junit 5. Use this
sparing, however.
