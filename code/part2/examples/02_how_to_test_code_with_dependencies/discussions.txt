message queue ---> processing ----> database

In order to test the processing we have to rely on the queue, set it up,
and rely on the database...

Also, from the design point of view, this make it hard to extend.


input data --> processing -> output data

The processing function just became a pure function. It does not
read from a queue, the data can come from anywhere. It does not
depend on a database, the data can go anywhere. Extensible.

Now we can easily unit test the processing function now than we 
had it before decoupling.
