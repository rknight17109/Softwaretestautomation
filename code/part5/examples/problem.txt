We are going to build the game of tic-tac-toe.

We have two players. One player can place a peg X, the other can place a peg O. One player can start, the other one can follow. They take turns to play.

The object of the game is for one player to place all of their peg in a row, a column, or in a line diagonally.

How do we start?

First start with a strategic design before getting into the
tactical design.

Let us come up with an intial strategic design.

Stratgic design is a high level initial design, not set
on stone, but gives us a starting point:
Grid
Pegs
Rules
Player

We want to separate the GUI from the logic.

We may want to start with the logic and then think of slapping
on a GUI on top of that.

Pick any of the abstractions from the strategic design. You may
pick what is the most interesting and the most valuable. Eliminate as a starting point those that do not provide a lot of value.

We can list the abstractions in the order of least to the most
valuable and interesting:
xPlayer
xPegs
xGrid
âœ”Rules

How to proceed:
-maintain a tests list
-think of principles to use
-and practices to follow
