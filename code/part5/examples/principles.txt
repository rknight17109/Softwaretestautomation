Principles that we may use:
-YAGNI - You Aren't Gonna Need It
-think of extensibility
-program with intent
-think of true abstractions from the domain
-keep code minimalistic
-keep code simple
-Keep it DRY, but do not overly optimize in tests
-follow the last responsible moment principle. Defer code until
you no longer can postpone.
-Apply the SLAP - Single Level of Abstraction Principle
